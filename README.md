# Eat-Da-Burger

Deployed Application Link

Eat-Da-Burger is a simple website application using Node, Express, MySql, JawsDW, Heroku, and a Custom ORM, that allows users to track burgers they wish to eat and then "devour" them, effectively removing the burgers from one list and placing it on an eaten list. The information stays persistent on the webpage for all users, so anyone can leave a burger they'd like to devour and other users can try them out.

Once downloaded, open the server.js in the integrated terminal of VS code and run "npm i" to download all npms used. Additionally, you will need to have access to an SQL GUI, such as MySQL Workbench, in order to create a local database.
